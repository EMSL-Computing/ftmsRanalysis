\usage{
transformation_counts(
  ftmsObj,
  transformDF,
  transformDigits = 4,
  transMass_cname,
  transID_cname,
  transOther_cname = NULL,
  parallel = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ftmsObj}{an object of class 'peakData' or 'compoundData', typically a
result of \code{\link{as.peakData}} or \code{\link{mapPeaksToCompounds}}.}

\item{transformDF}{a data.frame of known transformations of interest, with a
minimum of two columns (in any order): column 'transMass_cname' gives the
transformation masses which should be counted and column 'transID_cname'
gives a unique identifier (usually character string) for each
transformation mass}

\item{transformDigits}{the number of decimal places that should be retained
for the purposes of matching observed transformations to transformations in
\code{transformDF}. Defaults to 4}

\item{transMass_cname}{a character string giving the name of the column in
\code{transformDF} which gives the mass of the transformations of interest}

\item{transID_cname}{a character string giving the name of the column in
\code{transformDF} which gives a unique identifier for each transformation
of interest}

\item{transOther_cname}{a character vector specifying any other columns in
\code{transformDF} which should be returned with the transformation counts.
This is only applicable if \code{transformDF} has more than 2 columns with
information that should be carried through to results. Defaults to NULL}

\item{parallel}{logical, defaults to TRUE}
}
\value{
a data.frame with counts of the the number of times that each
  transformation in \code{transformDF} was observed in each sample
}
