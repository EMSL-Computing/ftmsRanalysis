\title{Determine Unique and Common Masses Between Two Groups}
\usage{
uniqueness_gtest(
  edata_df,
  group_df,
  data_scale,
  pres_fn,
  pres_thresh,
  pvalue_thresh = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{edata_df}{data.frame giving samples expression profiles for samples belonging to one of two groups}

\item{group_df}{data.frame giving sample names and column indicating group membership. Column indicating group membership should be named 'Group' and have exactly two unique values}

\item{data_scale}{character string giving scale the data is on. Current acceptable values are: "log", "log2", "log10", "abundance", "pres"}

\item{pres_fn}{character string indicating the function to use when determining if a peak/compound is present for a group. Current options include "nsamps" and "prop".}

\item{pres_thresh}{numeric value indicating the threshold (e.g. number of samples, proportion of samples, etc.), inclusive, that are required for a peak to be considered present/observed in a group.}

\item{pvalue_thresh}{p-value threshold at which masses with a g-test p-value less than or equal to \code{pval_threshold} are considered to be unique to the group with more observed proportion/number of samples, which also exceeds \code{pres_thresh}}
}
\description{
Use a g-test to compare two groups and determine which peaks are uniquely expressed in each group based on a p-value threshold
