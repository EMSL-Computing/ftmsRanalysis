\title{Construct a list of group comparisons}
\usage{
divideByGroupComparisons(ftmsObj, comparisons, control = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ftmsObj}{ftmsData object}

\item{comparisons}{dictates which pairwise comparisons to make. 'all' will create a matrix for all pairwise comparisons, 'control' will create a matrix for all comparisons against a specified control group, 'one-factor' will create a matrix of pairwise comparisons to be made where only one 'main_effect' changes between the two groups, or a list of specific comparisons to be made (e.g., list(c("Group1","Group2"),c("Group3","Group4"))) can be given.}

\item{control}{if wanting to only compare against a control, must specify which group or sample is the control}
}
\value{
a named list where each element consists of a subset of \code{ftmsObj} with
data from just two groups.
}
\description{
Construct a list where each element is a subset consisting of data for
a pair of groups. This is used to facilitate analysis and visualizations
of group comparisons.
